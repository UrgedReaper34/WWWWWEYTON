Player Spawns into the level with 100 Health and 0 Aura.
You will spawn with an empty inventory, but will be able to punch and kick for 5 and 10 damage respectively.

The goal of the game is to get to the BigBoss and kill the BigBoss.

The BigBoss has 1000 Health and does 250 Damage.

You are supposed to pick up weapons and potions which helps boost your chances of winning against the BigBoss.

Along the way, you will also meet smaller monsters who spawn on random tiles which will try to kill you. Run away if you cannot kill them!

Health Potions increase your health which you need to stay alive, and there is no maximum health. 

Aura Potion boosts your damage as a percentage. For example, 10 Aura allows you to do 10% more damage for all your weapons and basic attacks.

Tip: If you move to a monster tile, either fight the monster immediately or run away, do not use potions or view items as monsters can still damage you while doing those actions.
